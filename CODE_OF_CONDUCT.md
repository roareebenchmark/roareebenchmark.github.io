# Code of Conduct & Research Charter 🦁

The Roaree LLM Benchmark is committed to establishing a global standard for AI evaluation. To ensure our "Grades" and "Reports" carry the weight of professional authority, all members must adhere to this Charter of Research Rigor and Professional Conduct.

### ⚖️ Technical Governance & Faculty Oversight
Our results are only as good as our reputation. To maintain institutional credibility:
* **Faculty Review:** All primary benchmarking methodologies and final "Grades" are subject to audit and oversight by Columbia University faculty advisors.
* **Peer-Reviewed Opinions:** Members are encouraged to debate model performance, but all official Roaree Reports must be peer-reviewed by the internal research cohort before publication.
* **Conflict of Interest:** Members must disclose any affiliations with AI labs or hardware providers (e.g., Nvidia, Google, OpenAI) that could influence their grading data.

### 🧪 Standards of Research Rigor
We do not play with models; we audit them. 
* **Data Integrity:** Any fabrication, cherry-picking, or manipulation of benchmark results is grounds for immediate permanent removal and referral to Columbia’s academic integrity office.
* **Truth in Grading:** We provide honest, unbiased evaluations. Grades must be backed by reproducible technical data, not personal brand preference.
* **Reproducibility:** All code used to stress-test LLMs or Agents must be documented so other researchers can verify our findings.

### 🤝 Professional Conduct
While we are a high-energy, student-led group, we operate with corporate-level professionalism.
* **Zero Tolerance:** Harassment, discrimination, or unprofessional conduct in our "War Rooms" or digital channels will not be tolerated.
* **Collaboration:** We share a "War Room" mentality—critique the data, not the person. Constructive, high-level technical debate is expected.
* **Non-Disclosure:** Research findings and unpublished "Grades" are confidential until the official release date to prevent market or industry interference.

### 🚫 Prohibited Actions
* **Access Sharing:** Providing repository or internal grading tools to non-members.
* **Fraudulent Auditing:** Using automated scripts to "fake" human-in-the-loop grading benchmarks.
* **Plagiarism:** Presenting existing benchmarks or industry reports as original Roaree research.
