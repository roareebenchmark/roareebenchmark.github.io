# Grading Autonomous AI Agents 🤖

The frontier of machine intelligence has shifted from static chat to autonomous action. At Roaree Benchmark, we are architecting the rigorous standards required to grade **AI Agents**—systems designed to reason, use tools, and execute complex workflows independently.

### Why We Audit Agents
While standard LLMs are tested on text, Agents must be tested on **execution**. Our research cohort evaluates these systems on:
* **Tool Use & Logic:** Can the agent correctly navigate APIs, databases, and software to complete a task?
* **Reliability:** Does the agent maintain its objective over long-horizon tasks without "looping" or failing?
* **Safety & Governance:** Does the agent adhere to ethical constraints when operating in live environments?

### The Technical Grade
Our teams put the latest agentic frameworks through intensive "War Room" simulations. We move beyond the hype to provide the industry with a definitive grade on how these agents handle real-world deployment in finance, research, and engineering.
