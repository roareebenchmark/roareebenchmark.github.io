# Roaree LLM Model Benchmark Club

[APPLY TO TEAM](https://forms.gle/bTBuDyHQc46jLCDm7) | [HOW TO CONTRIBUTE](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Columbia University's LLM Benchmark Initiative**

**Roaree Benchmark** is a student-led research initiative at Columbia University dedicated to the rigorous evaluation of state-of-the-art **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

### 🔬 Models Under Evaluation
We will be benchmarking the industry's "Top 4" flagship models to establish our baseline:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4o** – Testing reasoning and multimodal capabilities.
2. **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** – Evaluating coding proficiency and nuance.
3. **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** – Assessing long-context window performance.
4. **Meta Llama 3.1 (405B)** – Analyzing open-weights vs. closed-source performance.

This is an **invite-only** collaborative space for vetted students from Columbia University and select external contributors working on responsible AI assessment and transparency.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to develop rigorous, transparent, and reproducible benchmarks for evaluating LLM capabilities, limitations, and safety characteristics. We aim to advance the field of AI evaluation through collaborative research and open scientific discourse.

## 🔒 Membership

**This project is opoen to all students**

- Vetted Columbia University students with demonstrated interest in AI research

## 🍕 Student Meetups: Grades & Slices
**Where high-stakes research meets Columbia culture.**

Serious auditing doesn't have to be dry. We plan to host regular technical meetups to break down the latest AI breakthroughs in a collaborative environment.

* **LLM Grading Sessions:** Join the "War Room" to stress-test and grade the newest, most dynamic LLM releases the moment they hit the news.
* **Fuel Your Research:** We keep the brainpower running with **complimentary pizza and snacks.**
* **Build Your Network:** Connect with a cohort of ambitious peers, alumni, and industry mentors who are as obsessed with the frontier of AI as you are.
* **Make an Impact:** Turn your casual Friday into a collaborative research sprint that lands on your resume and in global technical reports.

**Summer Research for Students Returning in Fall 2026**
